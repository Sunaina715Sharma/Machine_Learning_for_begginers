# Machine_Learning_for_begginers
as a bigginer need to look for types of algorithms and models we have
There are many models and various algorithms like linear regression (for multiple and linear relations, Logistic Regression, Decission Tree etc. So lets Start with the very first and simplest algorithm that is Simple Linear Regression
so lets start with simple linear regression
SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION      
Regression models describe the relationship between variables by fitting a line to the observed data. Linear regression models use a straight line, while logistic and nonlinear regression models use a curved line. Regression allows you to estimate how a dependent variable changes as the independent variable(s) change.
