# Machine_Learning_for_begginers
as a bigginer need to look for types of algorithms and models we have
There are many models and various algorithms like linear regression (for multiple and linear relations, Logistic Regression, Decission Tree etc. So lets Start with the very first and simplest algorithm that is Simple Linear Regression
so lets start with simple linear regression
SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION      
Regression models describe the relationship between variables by fitting a line to the observed data. Linear regression models use a straight line, while logistic and nonlinear regression models use a curved line. Regression allows you to estimate how a dependent variable changes as the independent variable(s) change.
Simple linear regression is used to estimate the relationship between two quantitative variables. You can use simple linear regression when you want to know


First! How strong the relationship is between two variables (e.g. the relationship between rainfall and soil erosion).
Second ! The value of the dependent variable at a certain value of the independent variable (e.g. the amount of soil erosion at a certain level of rainfall).

If you have more than one independent variable, use multiple linear regression instead( we will study this further).
