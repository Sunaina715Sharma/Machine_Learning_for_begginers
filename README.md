SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION      


Simple linear regression is a type of regression analysis where the number of independent variables is one and there is a linear relationship between the independent(x) and dependent(y) variable. The red line in the above graph is referred to as the best fit straight line. Based on the given data points, we try to plot a line that models the points the best. The line can be modelled based on the linear equation shown below.
y = a_0 + a_1 * x      ## Linear Equation



#Cost Function
The cost function helps us to figure out the best possible values for a_0 and a_1 which would provide the best fit line for the data points. Since we want the best values for a_0 and a_1, we convert this search problem into a minimization problem where we would like to minimize the error between the predicted value and the actual value.

LETS START WITH mULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION
Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of Simple Linear regression as it takes more than one predictor variable to predict the response variable. We can define it as """Multiple Linear Regression is one of the important regression algorithms which models the linear relationship between a single dependent continuous variable and more than one independent variable"""
